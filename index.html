                            <li>Ava Egan Tutoring (Tutor)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jan 2021 - Jun 2022</li>
                                    <li>I had the opportunity to offer tutoring to clients ranging from elementary to high school. This taught me how to effectively communicate on many different levels (age, comprehension, ability) with a wide variety of clients.</li>
                                    <li>I ran this “business” on my own including handling advertising, organizing, and execution. This was a great opportunity to run a business on a small scale utilizing my educational experience with minimal financial requirement.</li>
                                    <li>By focusing most of my tutoring on the subject of math, I was able to have confidence in my ability to tutor while also refining my own mathematical skills. This showed me how to achieve rewards financially and developmentally which I believe will be crucial to my success in future employment opportunities.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jan 2022 - Aug 2022</li>
                                    <li>Working with a broad base of customers, including high-line boat buyers, gave me insight into the world of retail sales and taught me many valuable skillsets while meeting individuals who had typically achieved a high level of financial success.</li>
                                    <li>The company I worked for had a high expectation for their level of customer experience which pushed me to effectively communicate in person and on the phone while transacting in a fun environment.</li>
                                    <li>I worked with a computerized database system where I entered inventory, cashiered, and recorded invoice orders. This helped me to better understand business processes ranging from inputting inventory to final transactions.</li>
                                    <li>I was able to work with marketing and specifically the social media team building their Instagram following. This opportunity was rewarding to my employer and showed me how to utilize social media to increase business traffic leading to increased retail sales.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Apr 2022 - Aug 2022</li>
                                    <li>As a salesperson for ONDA, I gained the skill of direct sales utilizing product knowledge to convert sales opportunities. Specifically, I worked trade shows for this company which was a great experience giving me the confidence to talk to potential buyers face to face.</li>
                                    <li>I also helped with product endorsement with their social media marketing team, this allowed me to further understand how social media and marketing can benefit smaller companies.</li>
                                    <li>We utilized a point-of-sale system which taught me valuable skills as technology has made this type of sales much more prevalent.</li>
